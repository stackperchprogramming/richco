RichCo Custom theme for https://richcopropertysolutions.com - based off _s -  https://underscores.me
===

This theme is structured as a theme file installable on WordPress. I used _S as a basis for the folder structure and approprate folders to hold static 'pages', 'classes'(php classes), and a 'workers'(javascript to php and vice versa) folders. 

The site is organized by functions.php which fires off the front-page.php file and loads pages based off the programmatically created menu. 

Getting Started
---------------

The site has been built around the idea that everything in the site including the business name can easily be altered using the customizer (WordPress built in site-builder). If it can't be altered here, any page can be altered in the pages folder - located at:

front-page.php - Site Landing Page 

/pages/about.php - about us page (menu item)

/pages/careers.php - careers page (menu item)

etc...

It's pretty self-explanatory.
The site's 'portal' area structure will not be described for security reasons.
